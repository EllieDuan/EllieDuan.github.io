We foster diversity in the workplace and encourage any interested individual of all stages (including postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students) and all backgrounds (including animal science, embryology, molecular biology and bioinformatics) to join our group. Please review the Lab Expectation page to see if this lab is a good fit for you. 


## Postdoctoral fellows
Postdoctoral research associate openings are currently available at Duan Lab. 

**Application process:** Candidates should email your application to Ellie, including:  

* A cover letter: your current position and research experience, and why you are interested in this lab
* Your updated CV  
* Research statement: a summary of your current and future research interests  
* Reference list: names of three references.

Submitted documents will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The qualified applicants will be contacted for a 30 min to 1 hour Zoom discussion. At this stage, you will also ask your references to send us letters. 


You will be invited for a formal interview process if we think you are a good fit. This will be a full-day on site interview including a lab/campus tour (COVID Update: via Zoom teleconference). You will give a 1-hour research seminar and have one-on-one discussions with Ellie and other faculties, post-docs and graduate students. This visit (in person or virtual) will also be an opportunity for you to access if this lab will be a good fit for you and your overall happiness and research productivities in the next few years. 

We will collect the feedback from everyone you meet and make the decision to either give you an offer or ask you to keep looking for other opportunities. If the offer is accepted, we will work with you on the hiring process, including the proposed starting date, salary, benefits, postdoc personal development plan, visa (if needed) and anything you will need for a successful career trajectory.    

**Successful experimental post-doc applicants will have:**

* A PhD in genetics, genomics, epigenetics, embryology, molecular biology or other discipline with relevant training
* Experience with AI, IVF, tissue culture, microscopy or NGS library preparation and data analysis
* At least two first author or co-first author papers with submitted, accepted, or published status in peer-reviewed journals
* Capable of independent research, writing manuscript, multitasking, and working in a collaborative atmosphere both within and outside the laboratory
* Goal oriented, highly self-motivated and dedicated to be productive and open to interdisciplinary projects


**Successful computational post-doc applicants will have:**

* A PhD in a biological, computational, or statistics-related field or other discipline with relevant training 
* Strong bioinformatics and programming skills: Python, R, C++ or Javascript   
* Ability to build pipelines and develop tools for multi-omics NGS data analysis
* At least two first author or co-first author papers with submitted, accepted, or published status in peer-reviewed journals
* Capable of independent research, writing manuscript, multitasking, and working in a collaborative atmosphere both within and outside the laboratory
* Goal oriented, highly self-motivated and dedicated to be productive and open to interdisciplinary projects


## Prospective Graduate students

For prospective students, we are unable to accept you directly, you are encouraged to apply directly to Ph.D. programs at Cornell University. However, your are encouraged to make a connection with any faculty members to discuss your interest of study before applying. 

Interested individuals should forward the following documents to
Ellie

* CV, including a list of publications/presentations (if any) and a list of relevant technical skills, names of 2 references.
* Unofficial transcripts (bachelor and/or master degree)
* Up to a 2-page statement of research experience, research interests and goals. 

Submitted documents will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The qualified applicants will be contacted for further discussions and set up a time for a Zoom conference. This will take 30 minutes to 1 hour and will allow you to have one-on-one discussion with Ellie on anything related to your submitted package. 


The successful candidate will participate in collaborative projects and execute basic research on genomic and epigenetic regulation in early embryonic development. The research areas include but are not limited to studying the molecular mechanism of environmental impacts on epigenetic regulation and the parental effects of embryonic development. Through these projects, the candidate will acquire strong technical expertise in advanced functional genomics research, bioinformatics, statistics, and next generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis. Further training opportunities will be provided to develop a wide array of professional and personal skills, including mentorship, scientific writing, project management, science communication, and career development. Stipend and tuition funding are also available on a competitive basis within the Department of Animal Science. 

The successful candidate will follow the application process of Cornell University and the Department of Animal Science requirements and guidelines:  

Cornell University: [https://gradschool.cornell.edu/](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/)  
College of Agriculture and Life Science: [https://cals.cornell.edu/](https://cals.cornell.edu/)

## Undergraduate students 
 
Current undergraduate students at Cornell University are more than welcome to reach out if you are interested in our research and would like to apply for an undergraduate research assistant, please forward the following documents to
Ellie

* CV, including your research experience if any, relevant courses you took, your GPA, awards and relevant skills
* Names of 2 references (can be professors you have took their classes)

Submitted documents will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The qualified applicants will be contacted for further discussions and set up a time for lab visit (or a Zoom conference). This will allow you to have one-on-one discussion with Ellie and others in the lab.

The successful candidate will be provided a proposed starting date, research project and background readings.
