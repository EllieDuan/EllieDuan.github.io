We foster diversity in the workplace and encourage any interested individual of all stages (including postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students) and all backgrounds (including animal science, embryology, molecular biology and bioinformatics) to join our group.


**Postdoctoral fellows**: Openings are currently available. Candidates should email your application to [Ellie Duan](jingyue.duan@gmail.com), including:  

* A cover letter: your current position and research experience and why you are interested in this lab
* Your updated CV  
* Research statement: a summary of your current and future research interests  
* Reference list: names of three references.

Submitted documents will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The qualified applicants will be contacted for further discussion and interview process. 

**Successful experimental post-doc applicants will have:**

* A PhD in genetics, genomics, epigenetics, embryology, molecular biology or other discipline with relevant training
* Experience with IVF, tissue culture, microscopy or NGS library preparation and data analysis
* At least two first author or co-first author papers with submitted, accepted, or published status in peer-reviewed journals
* Capable of independent research, writing manuscript, multitasking, and working in a collaborative atmosphere both within and outside the laboratory
* Goal oriented, highly self-motivated and dedicated to be productive and open to interdisciplinary projects


**Successful computational post-doc applicants will have:**

* A PhD in a biological, computational, or statistics-related field or other discipline with relevant training 
* Strong bioinformatics and programming skills: Python, R, C++ or Javascript   
* Ability to build pipelines and develop tools for multi-omics NGS data analysis
* At least two first author or co-first author papers with submitted, accepted, or published status in peer-reviewed journals
* Capable of independent research, writing manuscript, multitasking, and working in a collaborative atmosphere both within and outside the laboratory
* Goal oriented, highly self-motivated and dedicated to be productive and open to interdisciplinary projects


**Prospective Graduate students**

For prospective students, we are unable to accept you directly, you are encouraged to apply directly to Ph.D. programs at Cornell University. However, your are more than welcome to make a connection with us to discuss your interest of study before applying. 

Interested individuals should forward the following documents to:
[Ellie Duan](jingyue.duan@gmail.com)

* CV, including a list of publications/presentations (if any) and a list of relevant technical skills
* unofficial transcripts (bachelor and/or master degree)
* up to a 2-page statement of research experience, interests and goals. 

Submitted documents will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The qualified applicants will be contacted for further discussion and initiate interview process. 

The successful candidate will participate in collaborative projects and execute basic research on genomic and epigenetic regulation in early embryonic development. The research areas include but are not limited to studying the molecular mechanism of environmental impacts on epigenetic regulation and the parental effects of embryonic development. 

The successful candidate must be goal oriented, highly self-motivated and dedicated to be productive and open to interdisciplinary projects. Applicants should have strong interests in molecular biology, embryology, epigenetics, genomics or bioinformatics. Practical experience in cell culture, embryo culture, NGS library construction and/or analysis of NGS data is highly preferred but not required. Stipend and tuition funding are also available on a competitive basis within the Department of Animal Science.

Through these projects, the candidate will acquire strong technical expertise in advanced functional genomics research, bioinformatics, statistics, and next generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis. Further training opportunities will be provided to develop a wide array of professional and personal skills, including mentorship, scientific writing, project management, science communication, and career development.


The interested candidate will follow the application process of Cornell University and the Department of Animal Science requirements and guidelines:
