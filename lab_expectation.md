Under development 

Members of the Duan lab share an interest in animal genomics, epigenomics and bioinformatics, with students working on impact of environmental stressors on early embryonic development, single cell genomics and development of bioinformatics tools and pipelines. We value students and researchers of diverse backgrounds with strong quantitative skills and a passion for animal science
