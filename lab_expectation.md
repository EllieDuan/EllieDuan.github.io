Under development 

Members of the Duan lab share an interest in animal genomics, epigenomics and bioinformatics, with students working on impact of environmental stressors on early embryonic development, single cell genomics and development of bioinformatics tools and pipelines. We value students and researchers of diverse backgrounds with strong quantitative skills and a passion for animal science and critical thinking. We are a highly interactive group and we expect everyone in the group shares their personal expertise to help each other. It is important to us to maintain a supportive environment so everyone can do their best science. 

### General Expectations For Everyone

**Health and Safety First**

* Prioritize your own health (both physical and mental) and wellness.
* Balance your life, school work and research, seek for help if you need.   
* If your health status changes (including pregnancy), please inform me in private so we can discuss the best way to accommodate your needs.
* Familiarize yourself with the lab chemical hygiene plan.
* Follow all lab safety rules and guidelines (If you see an unsafe behavior, simply remind them the right way they should be doing).  

	* Please read the [Laboratory Safety Manual](https://ehs.cornell.edu/book/export/html/237)

**Attitude and Lab Citizenship**

* Be self-motivated, be curious and enthusiastic to science and new discoveries.
* Be self-managed on your time, schedule, workflow and communication.  
* Uphold high research integrity. Never manipulate or selectively exclude/expand data for an expected result. We have zero tolerance policy towards plagiarism and data fabrication.
* Be kind, treat each other with respect and care, share your "life hacks" with other members in the lab. Everyone in the lab should feel welcomed and appreciated for their contribution. 
* Maintain a positive, solution-oriented attitude towards your research. 
* Be honest (to yourself and to each other). Identifying your strength and expertise and be passionate about your research, own your project. 
* Be self-improvement without feeling the need to compete against your colleagues.  Success from others does not prevent yours, the success of each member contributes to everyone else's success.
* Be supportive and generous. Provide support to your peers by being a positive influence, engaging in discussions and sharing information about scholarship/career development opportunities.  
* Maintain an open-minded, inclusive, productive lab environment to support learning and research. Any inappropriate comments or behavior such as racism, sexism, discrimination and stereotyping will not be tolerated. We respect each other's cultural, religious and political differences, gender identity and sexual orientation.

**Participation and work schedules**

* Actively participate in all laboratory activities, such as lab meetings, departmental seminars, and collaboration meetings.
* Respond to all commutations	via email or lab Slack Channel in a timely manner during working hours. Monitor communication regularly in case of emergencies (freezer outages)	
* Be self-driven: you are working for yourself (your passion, degree, career goals and next life chapters) instead of working for anyone else. 
* Working schedules: develop a self-managed working style that optimizes your motivation and creativity. Working and studying based on your own rhythms and habits in sleep, eat and exercise. Your physical and mental health and life-work balance is important.   
* Don't worry about comparing your schedule to your peers' schedules, every person goes through more or less intense work based on their own deadlines and commitments. Productive is more important than working long hours. However, your self-managed schedule should always allow you to interact with other team members and participate in lab meetings and discussions. [[Working alone policy]](https://ehs.cornell.edu/research-safety/chemical-safety/laboratory-safety-manual/chapter-4-administrative-controls/47)   
* Vacations: lab members should plan to take a week paid-off in both the winter and summer breaks. Please discuss your vacation plan with me in advance and we can plan round the absence. 
* Absences: make sure to clear any anticipated absence with me in advance.
