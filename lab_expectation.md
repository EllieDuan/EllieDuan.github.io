Underdevelopment 

Members of the Duan lab share an interest in animal genomics, epigenomics and bioinformatics, with students working on impact of environmental stressors on early embryonic development, single cell genomics and development of bioinformatics tools and pipelines. We value students and researchers of diverse backgrounds with strong quantitative skills and a passion for animal science and critical thinking. We are a highly interactive group and we expect everyone in the group shares their personal expertise to help each other. It is important to us to maintain a supportive environment so everyone can do their best science. 

### General Expectations For Everyone

**Health and Safety First**

* Be supportive and generous. Provide support to your peers by being a positive influence, engaging in discussions and sharing information about scholarship/career development opportunities.  
* Maintain an open-minded, inclusive, productive lab environment to support learning and research.
