Under development 

Members of the Duan lab share an interest in animal genomics, epigenomics and bioinformatics, with students working on impact of environmental stressors on early embryonic development, single cell genomics and development of bioinformatics tools and pipelines. We value students and researchers of diverse backgrounds with strong quantitative skills and a passion for animal science and critical thinking. We are a highly interactive group and we expect everyone in the group shares their personal expertise to help each other. It is important to us to maintain a supportive environment so everyone can do their best science. 

### General Expectations For Everyone

**Health and Safety First**

* Prioritize your own health (both physical and mental) and wellness.
* Balance your life, school work and research, seek for help if you need.   
* If your health status changes (including pregnancy), please inform me in private so we can discuss the best way to accommodate your needs.
* Familiarize yourself with the lab chemical hygiene plan.
* Follow all lab safety rules and guidelines (If you see an unsafe behavior, simply remind them the right way they should be doing).  
	* Please read the [Laboratory Safety Manual](https://ehs.cornell.edu/book/export/html/237)
	* Environmental Health and Safety: <https://ehs.cornell.edu/research-safety>
	* Health Service: <https://health.cornell.edu/services>
	* Mental Health Care <https://health.cornell.edu/services/mental-health-care>
	* Fitness Center: <https://recreation.athletics.cornell.edu/fitness>
	* Student & Campus life: <https://scl.cornell.edu/get-involved> 
	* International Service: <https://international.globallearning.cornell.edu/>
	* English Language Support: <https://sce.cornell.edu/professional/program/els>

**Attitude and Lab Citizenship**

* Be self-motivated, be curious and enthusiastic to science and new discoveries. Be self-managed on your time, schedule, workflow and communication.  
* Uphold high research integrity. Never manipulate or selectively exclude/expand data for an expected result. 
	* We have zero tolerance policy towards plagiarism and data fabrication.
* Maintain a positive, solution-oriented attitude towards your research.
	* Need help? Steps in dealing with research challenges: 
		* think about solution yourself (don't ask someone by default);
		* Google it (or post questions on some active communities);
		* looking into literatures; 
		* discuss with lab mates; 
		* seek advice of the PI. 
		* If we are still struggling, we will seek for help outside the lab.   
* Be honest (to yourself and to each other). Identifying your strength and expertise and be passionate about your research, own your project. 
	* Made a mistake? Everyone will make mistakes in lab, own your mistake and apologize. Learn from it.  
* Be self-improvement without feeling the need to compete against your colleagues.  
	* Feel competitive? Success from others does not prevent yours, the success of each member contributes to everyone else's success. Own these feelings and improve yourself. 
* Lab citizenship
	* Be supportive and generous. Provide support to your peers by being a positive influence, engaging in discussions and sharing information about scholarship/career development opportunities.  
	* Be kind, treat each other with respect and care. Everyone in the lab should feel welcomed and appreciated for their contribution. 
* Maintain an open-minded, inclusive, productive lab environment to support learning and research. 
	* Any inappropriate comments or behavior such as racism, sexism, discrimination and stereotyping will not be tolerated. 
	* We respect each other's cultural, religious and political differences, gender identity and sexual orientation.   
	* Please take the training at: [Advancing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at Cornell](https://hr.cornell.edu/our-culture-diversity/diversity-inclusion/advancing-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-cornell)
* Lab harmony: maintain a clean and tide working bench and don't take other's supplies (pipettes, tips, tubes etc.) without their permission. 
	* Make sure to sign up for the shared equipments so others can plan for their own experiment accordingly. 
	* Treat all lab equipments with care and keep the chemical inventory updated. 


**Participation and Working Schedules**

* Actively participate in all laboratory activities, such as lab meetings (research update rotate with journal club, weekly or bi-weekly during summer), lab duties (gas refills, equipment maintenance, order supplies), and graduate seminars (every Thursday).
* Respond to all communications via email or lab Slack Channel in a timely manner during working hours. Monitor communications regularly in case of emergencies (freezer outages).	
* Be self-driven: you are working for yourself (your passion, degree, career goals and next life chapters) instead of working for anyone else. 
* Working schedules: develop a self-managed working style that optimizes your motivation and creativity. 
	* Night owl? Working and studying based on your own rhythms and habits in sleep, eat and exercise. Your physical and mental health and life-work balance is the most important.   
	* Don't worry about comparing your schedule to your peers' schedules, every person goes through more or less intense work based on their own deadlines and commitments. 
	* Productive is more important than working long hours. However, your self-managed schedule should always allow you to interact with other team members and participate in lab meetings and discussions. [[Working alone policy]](https://ehs.cornell.edu/research-safety/chemical-safety/laboratory-safety-manual/chapter-4-administrative-controls/47)   
* Vacations: lab members should plan to take a week paid-off in both the winter and summer breaks. Please discuss your vacation plan with me in advance and we can plan round the absence. 
* Absences: make sure to clear any anticipated whole day absence during working weeks with me in advance. 


**Lab Notebook and Data Backup**

* Your lab notebook belongs to the University and please do not take away with you. 
	* Maintain an organized and transcribed copy of wet lab and computational notebook in Evernote online. The additional information can be upload as photos [examples](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2211068212471834)  
* Data backup: sync all computer with shared Google Drive backup. Genomic data and pipeline script will need to be backed up on [BioHPC](https://biohpc.cornell.edu/lab/guides/hosted_servers_on_BioHPC.pdf) (not automatically).  
* Data reproducibility: Make all protocols, data, and pipeline scripts freely and publicly available upon publication on lab GitHub and/or Protocols.io repositories. 

**Conference**

* Everyone is encouraged to present and attend research conference at least once a year. Our lab will support you one conference/yr if you present a poster or talk. 
* You should also make a good effort to obtain partial/full student scholarship for travel grant. This include the travel scholarship offered by Department, Grad school and the Conference, volunteering at the Conference and sharing rooms. 
* Please discuss with me in advance about the conference you are interested in. We will then work on the abstract (3-week prior to the submission deadline) and help you practice the presentation (3-week prior to the conference). 



### Specific Expectations
 
  
**PI mentor style**  

I usually tailor my mentoring styles to each individual member in the lab and adjust over time as they need. It is essential to have open and regular communications to make sure you have the support and training you need.
