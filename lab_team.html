        	<h5 style="font-weight: bold"> Jingyue Ellie Duan, Ph.D </h5>
        	<p> 
        	Ellie is an animal biologist with strong genomics and bioinformatics training. She received B.S. (elite program) of Biology in 2014 at the <a href="http://international.scu.edu.cn/Home/Index/post/cat_id/49/art_id/354.html">Department of Life Science and Biology</a>, <a href="http://en.scu.edu.cn/">Sichuan University</a> (SCU), China. During her undergraduate, Ellie had research trainings in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yi_Yang58">molecular biology </a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qun_Sun3">microbiology </a> labs in her sophomore and junior years. In the senior year, Ellie joined a 3+1 exchange student program and came to the <a href="http://animalscience.uconn.edu/"> Department of Animal Science</a>,  <a href="https://uconn.edu/">University of Connecticut</a> (UConn). She finished her senior design with an honor thesis in <a href="http://animalscience.uconn.edu/faculty/Kumar%20Venkitanarayanan.php">food microbiology.</a> 
        	</p>
        	
        	<p> 
        	Ellie received her Ph.D. in 2018 from UConn under <a href="http://animalscience.uconn.edu/faculty/Xiuchun%20(Cindy)%20Tian.php"> Dr. Xiuchun Cindy Tian</a>. During her Ph.D. trainings, she studied functional genomics and epigenetics in domestic animals cattle and sheep, using multiple NGS and bioinformatics approaches. Ellie defined the first time of DNA methylation and X chromosome dynamic regulation during bovine early embryonic development. Moreover, she identified 13 novel genetic imprinting genes in sheep, and revealed the maternal nutrition impact on fetal imprinted gene expression. 
          </p>
        	
        	<p> 
        	To have a better understanding of the molecular mechanism in coordinate transcription regulation, Ellie joined the laboratory of <a href="https://www.larschanlab.com/">Dr. Erica Larschan</a> at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/biomed/molecular-cell-biochemistry/"> Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology & Biochemistry (MCB), Brown University</a> for her postdoctoral training. Here, she combines multiple approaches includes genetics, biochemistry, genomics, microscopy imaging to study chromatin accessibility and transcription during <a href="https://www.larschanlab.com/research-3">zygotic genomic activation</a> in <i> Drosophila </i> early embryos.
        	</p>
        	
        	 <p> 
        	 In July 2021, Ellie will join the  <a href="https://ansci.cals.cornell.edu/">Department of Animal Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a> as an Assistant Professor of Functional Genomics.  She aims to establish a model to study the trans-general inheritances from parents to embryos and study how environmental stressors such as IVF technology, heat stress and parental nutrition that could impact the embryo development. Her ultimate goal is to not only improve the health of livestock animals but also benefit to human society.
