title: Education

Our primary goal in teaching and mentoring is to spark a studentâ€™s curiosity and further motivate their self-learning skills through positive interactions. We found that student loose attention and interest when they cannot see the big picture of the knowledge, especially when they come from different education backgrounds or will choose different career paths rather than doing research. Therefore, we use three approaches to meet our goals: 1) we teach with full enthusiasm for a subject to convince students to enjoy learning; 2) we create a positive learning environment to show availabilities; 3) we design class from simpler and familiar concepts and then build it up to the complex problems. 


Further, we have improved pedagogy by completing the [Certificate in College Teaching Program](https://gcci.uconn.edu/). Through one year and nine credits of both [theory and practical classes](https://gcci.uconn.edu/additional-courses/), and with five pedagogy [books](books.md) for our reading circle, we built up our own [multicultural teaching portfolio](teachings/portfolio.pdf) in college-based education and the [teaching philosophy.](teachings/philosophy.pdf)

Moreover, we are strongly committed to strengthening the relationship among students within a diverse community. We promote equity and inclusion in classrooms with students from diverse racial and socio-economic backgrounds. Also, we collaborate with students who have diverse academic backgrounds, such as from Departments of Computer Science and Statistics. We will use our training, skills and positions to ensure inclusivity in the classroom and academia at Cornell and to increase equity, diversity and collaboration within our community and in society.
